    Celebrity Problem
    <---------------->

    A celebrity is a person who is known to everyone in a party, but he does not knows anyone over there.

    Given a square matrix M[][] of size N X N, such that M[i][j] = 1 means ith person knows jth person, the task is to find 
    the celebrity. A celebrity is a person who is known to all but does not know anyone. Return the index of the celebrity, 
    if there is no celebrity return -1.

    Note: Follow 0 based indexing and M[i][i] will always be 0.

    matrix = [
        [0, 1, 1, 1],  // Person 0 knows 1, 2, 3
        [0, 0, 1, 1],  // Person 1 knows 2, 3
        [0, 0, 0, 1],  // Person 2 knows 3
        [0, 0, 0, 0]   // Person 3 knows no one
    ];

    Output: 3

    - In the second iteration, matrix[1][3] === 1, so top++ (person 1 knows person 3, so person 1 can't be a celebrity).
    - In the third iteration, matrix[2][3] === 1, so top++ (person 2 knows person 3, so person 2 can't be a celebrity).

    Now, top === 3, so person 3 is the only remaining candidate for the celebrity.
